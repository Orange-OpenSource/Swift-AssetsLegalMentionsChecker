/// Program which has the aim of finding in images if metadata contain legal mentions line.
/// Indeed we might need to be sure all the assets included in a project have the legal mentions like
/// copyrights or licenses. These kinds of details are stored in the metadata of images.
///
/// For now only the PNG messages are managed. Such details are expected in metadata fields named TIFF, IPTC and PNG.
///
/// Program exists:
///     - (-1): something wrong occured (command line options for example)
///     - (0): no error appeared, normal exit without image processing (e.g. display help)
///     - (+1): normal exit but failure occured during check of images (i.e. at least 1 file does not have legal mention in credits)
///     - (+2): normal exit, all files contain the legam mention
///
/// - Author: Pierre-Yves Lapersonne
