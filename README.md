# Swift-AssetsLegalMentionsChecker

Swift-written tool to use in command line to check if images contain copyright / legal mentions / credits in metadata.
This project is built with Xcode.

## Managed files

This current version deals only with PNG file (with .png or .PNG extensions), and looks for some fields in the metadata : TIFF, IPTC and PNG.
If will check in these fields if the mention to look for is _exactly_ the defined value.

## Executables

If you are looking for the executables you can have a look on folder _~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData/Swift-AssetsLegalMentionsChecker-XXX/Build/Products/Debug/_ where XXX is a kind of random string generated by Xcode. You have to build the project with Xcode before.

## Run the program

```shell
EXECUTABLE --help
```
